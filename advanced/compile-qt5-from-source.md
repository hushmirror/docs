# Configure, Build, Install & Setup Qt5.15.2 Source on Ubuntu 18.04 with X11 Support

This tutorial will teach you how to compile from source via CLI and enable a more customizable solution for building Qt apps on different opearting systems. When compiling Qt5.15.2 yourself, you are empowered with a configuration that is constant throughout the Linux universe. Some deps may need to be added, but overall, this details a thorough solution to building binaries from Qt source code like Hush SilentDragon or Hush SilentDragonLite. This process is also very similar with compiling Qt apps on your ARM64 devices like RPi 400, Rock64, PineBook64.

*Note: This tutorial doesn't include Qtwebengine*

## Remove & purge all Qt* from apt
sudo apt -y remove qt5* libqt5* qtcreator && sudo autoremove

## Download Qt5.15.2 Source to qt5-sources folder
mkdir qt5-sources && cd qt5-sources && mkdir build-shadow

wget https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.15/5.15.2/single/qt-everywhere-src-5.15.2.tar.xz

### Verify MD5 hash
md5sum qt-everywhere-src-5.15.2.tar.xz

```
e1447db4f06c841d8947f0a6ce83a7b5  qt-everywhere-src-5.15.2.tar.xz
```
### Move into build-shadow directory to configure your Qt5.15.2
cd build-shadow

## Install Qt5 Minimal Dependencies
sudo apt install build-essential libfontconfig1-dev libdbus-1-dev libfreetype6-dev libicu-dev libinput-dev libxkbcommon-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev libglib2.0-dev 

## (Optional) Install VC4 Drivers for RPi 4 type devices (i.e. cortex-a53 & cortex-a72)
sudo apt install libgles2-mesa-dev libgbm-dev libdrm-dev

### Install X11 Support Dependencies (optional, but for Hush apps, I had to use X11; EGLFS launched, but I wasn't able to use the GUI)
sudo apt install libx11-dev libxcb1-dev  libxext-dev libxi-dev libxcomposite-dev libxcursor-dev libxtst-dev libxrandr-dev libfontconfig1-dev libfreetype6-dev libx11-xcb-dev libxext-dev libxfixes-dev libxi-dev libxrender-dev libxcb1-dev  libxcb-glx0-dev  libxcb-keysyms1-dev libxcb-image0-dev  libxcb-shm0-dev libxcb-icccm4-dev libxcb-sync-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxcb-shape0-dev  libxcb-randr0-dev  libxcb-render-util0-dev  libxcb-util0-dev  libxcb-xinerama0-dev  libxcb-xkb-dev libxkbcommon-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev

## Configure Qt 5.15.2 

../qt-everywhere-src-5.15.2/configure -v -bundled-xcb-xinput -opensource -confirm-license -release -ssl -glib -no-feature-geoservices_mapboxgl -qt-pcre -nomake examples -no-compile-examples -nomake tests -reduce-exports -system-freetype -fontconfig -qpa xcb

### Make the configuration *(-j 4 is number of cpus you want to use)*
`make -j 4`

### Install Qt5.15.2 into: *(default) /usr/local/*
sudo make install

*Note: Check and make sure ./configure has required deps; if you installed the deps, but still receiving errors, remove config.cache and ./configure again.*

**Tip:** *If you want to view your configuration summary, you may do so via nano config.summary in build-shadow directory*

## Update profile to know where Qt5.15.2 bins are

`nano ~/.bashrc`

### Add this at the bottom of your .bashrc file.

```
# set PATH for Qt5.15.2
export PATH="/usr/local/Qt-5.15.2/bin:$PATH"
```

### Reload your ~/.bashrc file & create new shell window. 
```
source ~/.bashrc
CTRL+SHIFT+T
ALT+1 
exit
```
### Verify Qt5.15.2 has been installed
`qmake --version`

```
QMake version 3.1
Using Qt version 5.15.2 in /usr/local/Qt-5.15.2/lib
```
## Build your happy Qt5.15.2 app

`./build.sh`
