# Silent Dragon

This documentation is how you setup Silent Dragon, which is the Hush full node wallet.

## 1) Setup hushd

First you want to setup the Hush daemon (hushd). This enables your computer to download the complete Hush blockchain.

## 2) Install Silent Dragon

**Make sure you make a paper backup of your seed phrases!**

Pick either the [binary release](https://git.hush.is/hush/SilentDragon/releases) or [compile it yourself](https://git.hush.is/hush/SilentDragon/src/branch/master/README.md). I personally compile but some prefer binaries.
