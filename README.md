## Hush Documentation

Most people visiting this page will be seeking how to setup their wallets. We also have a section for those interested in running servers.

### Wallets

If you are looking to setup a Hush wallet, then you have the following two choices dependant upon your requirements:

- [Setup Hush full node with hushd](sd.md)
- [Setup Hush lite wallet featuring Hushchat](sdl.md)

As for mobile wallets:
- [Hush Android app](sda.md) is a companion app which pairs with either of the above two options. A mobile lite wallet is in development.
- Hush does not have an iOS app yet, care to make one?
