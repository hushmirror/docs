## Hush Documentation

Most people visiting this page will be seeking how to setup their wallets. We also have a section for those interested in running servers and those interested in mining Hush.

### Wallets

![funny money](images/wallet.gif)

If you are looking to setup a Hush wallet, then you have the following two choices:

- [Setup Hush full node wallet with hushd](sd.md)
- [Setup Hush lite wallet featuring HushChat](sdl.md)

As for mobile wallets:
- [Hush Android app](sda.md) is a companion app which pairs with either of the above two options. A mobile lite wallet is in development. [We recommend you install this using our custom F-Droid repository here](https://git.hush.is/jahway603/sda-fdroid).
- Hush does not have an iOS app yet, care to make one?

### HushChat 

Currently [HushChat](https://git.hush.is/hush/hushchat) is only available in the Hush lite wallet and it is in beta mode.

If you are interested in testing it, then [please refer to our guide here](https://git.hush.is/hush/hushchat/src/branch/master/guide.md).

#### Miners
