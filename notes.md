# Summary

TLDR: ECC profits directly from their own users lack of privacy.

The company behind Zcash, Electric Coin Company, works directly with Law Enforcement and blockchain analysis companies, whose largest customers are Law Enforcement Organizations (LEOs).

This is the Military-Industrial-Surveillance complex, where ECC directly profits from their users lack of privacy

The Hush community finds this to be an egregious conflict-of-interest
What follows are important summaries and quotes from this video:

The video was removed from YouTube and then uncensored by the Monero community

The companies actually make fun of Zcash optional privacy, but say if people use the tech, they can't track it.

It shows that ECC profits directly from their own users lack of privacy.

Ciphertrace and other companies are starting to work with Zcash team at Electric Coin Company on integration
of tools for that blockchain.

    1:00:00 - Summary of Bitcoin ATM usage: stolen CC's, darknet markets, overseas remittance to family members
    1:03:24 - Mixers can be wiretapped, Denial-of-Service'd and have code errors, not as good as privacy coins.
    1:03:55 - Custody and exit fraud risk of "mixers" are inferior to protocol level privacy. Privacy coins have less risk of theft, almost none
    1:04 -

We also have projects that are funded by Law Enforcement Organizations,
to work on Monero and Zcash tools and support, so there is good interest
in the research funding side, as well as the investigation side.

``` - Dave Jevans, CEO of Ciphertrace 

The other thing, we are in touch with some communities and I would say, for example, we are getting a lot of helpful attitude from the Zcash Community, they were able to explain to us how exactly coin anonymization feature worked. Of course, if you have a suspect that knows what he is doing, he is not making stupid mistakes, their community is, of course, not in a position to help.

  * Very few options, forensics tools don't help. Monero + Tor is a dead end.
  * Seizing phones is the easiest way to de-anonymize privacy coins!
